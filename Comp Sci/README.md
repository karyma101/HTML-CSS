## Data Structures

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively. They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help manage and organize data.

Abstract Datatype

An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

### Stack

A stack is a data structure which contains an ordered set of data. Contains data nodes and supports three main operations, push, pop and peek. Implementations include a linked list or array and can have a limited size. Pushing data into a full stack results in a stack overflow. Stack process data last in, first out

- Push: adds data to the “top” of the stack
- Pop: returns and removes data from the “top” of the stack
- Peek: returns data from the “top” of the stack without removing it
