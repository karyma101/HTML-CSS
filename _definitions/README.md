# Definitions

### ARIA

- Accessible Rich Internet Applications

### Bash

- **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell created by Brian Fox to replace the Bourne Shell.
- Bash is the default shell for Linux and Mac

### CSS

- Cascading Style Sheet

- Style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

### DOM

- Document Object Model

- A cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (API).

### Headless Browser

- Web Browsers without a graphical user interface that can be controlled from a command line interface programmatically for the purpose of web page automation (eg. functional testing, scraping, unit testing).
- Most Common Headless Browsers:
  - Headless Chromium
  - Zombie
  - SlimerJS

### HTML

- Hyper Text Markup Language
- Commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

### HTTP

- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

- Application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

### JavaScript

- A high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

### JSON

- JavaScript Object Notation

- It is the primary data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication (AJAJ), largely replacing XML (used by AJAX). Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages. The JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford. It is currently described by two competing standards, RFC 7159 and ECMA-404. The ECMA standard is minimal, describing only the allowed grammar syntax, whereas the RFC also provides some semantic and security considerations. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. The JSON filename extension is .json.

### Native from Web Tech

- Flutter
- React Native

### separation of concerns
- Separation of concerns is a design principle stating that code should be separated based on its purpose in a program. In web development, that generally means the structure of a page is defined in an HTML document, styles are stored in a CSS file, and code that defines dynamic behavior is stored in a JavaScript file.

### URL

- Uniform Resource Locator
- A reference to a resource that specifies the location of the resource on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of uniform resource identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. A URL implies the means to access an indicated resource, which is not true of every URI. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.

### WCAG

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

- Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design ensures both “direct access” (i.e., unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).

### Web Api

- When writing code for the Web using JavaScript, there are a great many APIs available. Below is a list of all the interfaces (that is, types of objects) that you may be able to use while developing your Web app or site.

### Web Browsers

- Software used to retrieve, present, traverse information on the world wide web.
- Most Common Browsers:
  - Chrome
  - Safari
  - Internet Explorer (Note: not Edge, referring to IE 9 to IE 11)
  - Firefox
  - Edge

### Web Servers

- A web server is a process running on a computer that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses.

### Webviews

- Used by Native OS, in a native application to run a web page.
- Most Common Solutions for Webview development:
  - Cordova (native phone/tablet apps)
  - NW.js (desktop apps)
  - Electron (desktop apps)
