### ARIA

- Accessible Rich Internet Applications

### CSS

- Cascading Style Sheet

- Style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

### DOM

- Document Object Model

- A cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (API).

### Headless Browser

- Web Browsers without a graphical user interface that can be controlled from a command line interface programmatically for the purpose of web page automation (eg. functional testing, scraping, unit testing).
- Most Common Headless Browsers:
  - Headless Chromium
  - Zombie
  - SlimerJS

### HTML

- Hyper Text Markup Language
- Commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

### HTTP

### JSON

## Native from Web Tech

- Flutter

### URL

- Uniform Resource Locator
- A reference to a resource that specifies the location of the resource on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of uniform resource identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. A URL implies the means to access an indicated resource, which is not true of every URI. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.
