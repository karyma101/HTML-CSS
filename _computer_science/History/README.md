- Charles Babbage shifted the paradigm in 1837, when he proposed the “The Analytical Engine” - a computer that could perform various mathematical operations and conditional statements. For instance, you would feed the engine a program that translated to: “If the input is greater than 7, output 12”. Then, you would be able to input numbers into the engine and if that number was greater than 7, the engine would output 12. This seems simple, but for the time, a machine like this was unheard of!
