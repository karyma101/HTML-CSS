- Charles Babbage shifted the paradigm in 1837, when he proposed the “The Analytical Engine” - a computer that could perform various mathematical operations and conditional statements. For instance, you would feed the engine a program that translated to: “If the input is greater than 7, output 12”. Then, you would be able to input numbers into the engine and if that number was greater than 7, the engine would output 12. This seems simple, but for the time, a machine like this was unheard of!

- In 1947, Bell Labs invented something that would change computer science forever - transistors. Transistors are devices used to switch and amplify electronic signals: the basic building blocks of computers. The old method of switching and amplifying signals used unwieldy, fragile glass tubes. Transistors were sturdier, cheaper, and smaller, and scientific advances have only enhanced those traits. The first transistors were the size of the palm of your hand. Now, the average transistor is only the size of a couple of molecules!

- In fact, the computer scientist Gordon Moore predicted that transistors would get exponentially smaller. Since transistors are grouped into chips called integrated circuits, the prediction is expressed in those terms: Moore predicted that the amount of transistors in an integrated circuit would double every two years, and that prediction has held true! This is popularly known as Moore’s law.
