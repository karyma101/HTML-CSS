# Definitions
- **Control flow**: is the order in which instructions are executed.

- **Control Structure**: alter control flow in a program.
    - Conditional: “if some condition is met, then do X. Otherwise, do Y”.
    - Loop: “do something Z number of times” or “do something repeatedly until some condition is met”.
    - Exception: “do steps A, B, C. If an error occurs, stop, and do steps J, K, L”.
    
- **Loops**: A loop is a structure in programming where the instructions are written once, but a computer can execute them multiple times. Each execution of those instructions is called an iteration. For loops (count-controlled loops) repeat for a specified number of times. While loops (condition-controlled loops) repeat until a condition changes. For each loops (collection-controlled loops) repeat for each item in a collection.

- **Functions**: A sequence of instruction that preforms specific task, packaged as a unit. Parameters and arguments are both inputs to a function. Parameters refer abstractly to a function’s inputs and arguments are the actual values inputted.

- **Hardcoding**: when we use values without assigning it to a variable. It may be faster if value is shorter than variable name and not repeated many times, but more room for error.

- **Primitive Data Types**: Primitives are the most basic data types, so basic that you can find them in pretty much every programming language.

    - Numbers: original data type, the earliest computers communicated only in numbers using binary computation. Used for describing, calculating, counting.
    
    - Strings: any sequence of characters(letters, spacing, number or symbols) typically used to represent text or speech. Used for displaying data that uses text or symbols, adding or removing text, modifying characters, to let the computer communicate with us in a human readable way.

    - Boolean: represent the logical ideas of true and false. Used for determining validity, making decisions

- **Programming**: the mental process of creatively coming up with a way of giving instructions to any machine, not necessarily a computer.
