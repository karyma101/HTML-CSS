# Definitions

- **Programming**: the mental process of creatively coming up with a way of giving instructions to any machine, not necessarily a computer. 

- **Hardcoding**: when we use values without assigning it to a variable. It may be faster if value is shorter than variable name and not repeated many times, but more room for error.

- **Primitive Data Types**: Primitives are the most basic data types, so basic that you can find them in pretty much every programming language.

    - Numbers: original data type, the earliest computers communicated only in numbers using binary computation. Used for describing, calculating, counting.
    
    - Strings: any sequence of characters(letters, spacing, number or symbols) typically used to represent text or speech. Used for displaying data that uses text or symbols, adding or removing text, modifying characters, to let the computer communicate with us in a human readable way.

    - Boolean: represent the logical ideas of true and false.
