# GraphQL

Strongly typed query language and runtime for your data created by facebook.

## Types

- Scalar

  - Int: A signed 32-bit integer
  - Float: A signed double precision floating point value
  - String: A UTF-8 character sequence
  - Boolean: true or false
  - ID: a unique identifier serialized as a string

- Object

  - Most of the types you define in graphql schema are object types. An object type contains a collection of fields each of which can be either a scalar or another object type.

- Query

  - Defines exactly which graphql queries client can execute against your data graph. It resembles an object type but its name is always Query

  ```javascript
  type Query {
    getBooks: [Book]
    getAuthors: [Author]
  }

  // This Query type defines two available queries: getBooks and getAuthors. Each query returns a list of the corresponding type.

  // With a REST-based API, books and authors would probably be returned by different endpoints (e.g., /api/books and /api/authors). The flexibility of GraphQL enables clients to query both resources with a single request.
  ```

  - Mutation

    - Similar in structure and purpose as Query type. The mutation type defines supported write operations

    ```javascript
    type Mutation {

    addBook(title: String, author: String): Book
    }

    // This Mutation type defines a single available mutation, addBook. The mutation accepts two arguments (title and author) and returns a newly created Book object. As you'd expect, this Book object conforms to the structure that we defined in our schema.
    ```

  - Input Type

  - Special object types that allow you to pass objects as arguments to queries and mutations.

  ```javascript
  type Mutation {
    createPost(post: PostAndMediaInput): Post
  }

  input PostAndMediaInput {
    title: String
    body: String
    mediaUrls: [String]
  }
  ```
