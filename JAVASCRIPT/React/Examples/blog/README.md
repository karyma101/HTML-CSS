- Create Action and Reducer Folder
- Create Action Creator includes type, payload
- Create Reducer, call { combineReducers } from 'redux', export default combineReducers({})
- Import { Provider } from 'react-redux', wrap <Provider><App/></Provider>
- Import { createStore} from 'redux'
- Import reducers from './reducers'
- <Provider store={createStore(reducers)}></Provider>
- Import { connect } from 'react-redux' wherever you want to communicate with the Provider
  - export default connect()(ComponentName)
    - const mapStateToProps = (state) => {}
    - function mapStateToProps(){}
      - mapStateToProps is always going to receive state as first params, and is always going to return an object that is going to show up as props, inside of our object.
- export default connect(mapStateToProps)(componentName)
- import { action } from '../actions', and place connect(mapStateToProps, {action})(componentName), then place in event handler onClick={()=>this.props.action()}
- whenever we put the {action} inside the connect function it automatically places the function inside of a dispatch function

- import {createStore, applyMiddleware} from 'redux'
- import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
- <Provider store={createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk))}>
