- Comes from the greek word, 'genuine' and 'author'

Types of Authentication
  Single Factor: one piece of identification used(driver license).
  Two-Factor: two piece of identification used(Bank Card and PIN).
  Multi-Factor: (Knowledge, Inherence, Possession).

Password Vulnerabilities
  Man-in-the-middle Attacks: 3rd party taps the communication stream.
  Phishing Scams: Sites that mimic real sites, storing your password with a third-party.
  Server Attacks: Passwords stolen from databases on servers with security hole.
  Dictionary/Brute Force Attacks: Trying passwords until right one is guessed.

Password Hashing
  -Shash function is an algorithm that converts input to a set length of output.
  -The same input will always generate the same output, small change generate widely different output.
  -It is one way, without the input message, the hash cannot be decoded.
  -The larger the hash, the harder to crack.

Encryption
  -Reversible
  -Key-based, anyone with the key can decrypt the data into original from

Salting the Hash
  -A random sequence that is added to a password before the Hashing.
  -Guarantees every hash is unique in the system, even if the users have same password.
  -Ensures further difficulty for hackers

Bcrypt
  -Commonly used hashing library for hashing Passwords.
  -Generates random salt stored as part of hash.
  -Work Factor is the number of times the hash is applied.
  -(Work Factor)(Salt).(Hash)
  -bcrypt.compare(password, hash(err, result) => {
    if(result === true){
      res.send('Login Success')
    } else {
      res.status(403)
        .send('Invalid Password')
    }
  })
