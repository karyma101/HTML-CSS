# TypeScript

- **Basic Types**
  - let boolean: boolean = true
  - let decimal: number = 6
  - let string: string = 'hello'
  - let array: number[] = [1, 2, 3]

- **Tuple** types allow you to express an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known, but need not be the same.
  - let x: [string, number]

- **enum** is a way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric values. By default, enums begin numbering their members starting at 0. You can change this by manually setting the value of one of its members.
  - enum Color { Red, Green, Blue = 5}
